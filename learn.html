Recognizing her limitations, the stumbler at least has a serious foe to overcome and transcend. The stumbler has an outstretched arm, ready to receive and offer assistance. Her friends are there for deep conversation, comfort and advice.

External ambitions are never satisfied because there’s always something more to achieve. But the stumblers occasionally experience moments of joy. There’s joy in freely chosen obedience to organizations, ideas and people. There’s joy in mutual stumbling. There’s an aesthetic joy we feel when we see morally good action, when we run across someone who is quiet and humble and good, when we see that however old we are, there’s lots to do ahead.

The stumbler doesn’t build her life by being better than others, but by being better than she used to be. Unexpectedly, there are transcendent moments of deep tranquillity.

Montessori was an early voice who pointed out that the main purpose of schooling (especially early schooling) was to help students learn and deeply internalize the most powerful outlooks that have been discovered/invented by humans. She observed that otherwise children wind up living in the 20th century but with a 10th century (or much earlier) outlook ...</span></span></p></div></div></details><details id="https://www.notion.so/1a2c5abcf5be80d395c1e97ef9675bb3" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Toggle "><summary class="Toggle__Summary"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString"><a class="SemanticString__Fragment SemanticString__Fragment--Link" href="https://nav.al/peace-motion">Happiness Is Peace in Motion</a></span><span class="SemanticString"> (Naval Ravikant)</span></span></summary><div class="Toggle__Content"><blockquote id="https://www.notion.so/1a2c5abcf5be8007a089fc7c4805a8bf" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Quote"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Here’s a phrase I like: “Peace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion.” Someone who’s peaceful at rest will end up happy when they do an activity.

The crisis of incommensurability tripped off the Euclidean approach to mathematics.

Sometimes the extensions were made for what amounted to aesthetic reasons, and often we gave up some property of the earlier number system. Thus we came to a number system that is unreasonably effective even in mathematics itself; witness the way we have solved many number theory problems of the original highly discrete counting system by using a complex variable.

The idea that theorems follow from the postulates does not correspond to simple observation.
